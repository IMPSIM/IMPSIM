_Figure 3-13:_ Example of a screw joint connecting two links.
The <tt>SCREW</tt> statement defines a screw joint connecting two links of the system (see figure 3-13).

===Format===
 <tt>SCREW</tt> (link name, link name) = joint name
where each _link name_ refers to the alphanumeric name given to one of the two connected links and _joint name_ is an arbitrarily chosen alphanumeric name assigned to the joint.

===Example===
 <tt>SCREW</tt> (BOLT, NUT) = THRD
defines a screw joint named _THRD_ connecting two links named _BOLT_ and _NUT_.

===Notes===
# Each screw joint in the system must be defined by a separate <tt>SCREW</tt> statement.
# No other joint of any type may be defined having the same _joint name_. An attempt to do so results in the deletion of the previously defined joint of the same _joint name_ (and all information dependent on it); a message is printed.
# The same _link name_ may appear in more than one statement defining a joint.
# Each statement defining a joint must refer to two distinct _link names_. An attempt to join a link to itself causes the statement to be ignored and a message to be printed.
# Two local coordinate systems must be chosen for each _joint name_ (see figure), and defined by two subsequent <tt>DATA LINK</tt> statements. One local coordinate system (u,v,w) is rigidly attached to the first _link name_, while the other (u',v',w') is rigidly attached to the second _link name_. The local w and w' axes must be collinear and must be directed along the joint axis; both must have the same positive sense. The local u and u' axes must be chosen such that, at one position of the joint, they are collinear and the two local origins coincide (see figure).
# If an appropriate <tt>DATA LINK</tt> statement is not defined before an <tt>EXECUTE</tt> or <tt>EXECUTE HOLD</tt> statement is encountered, it is assumed that the corresponding local coordinate system(s) is (are) coincident with the link coordinate system; no message is printed.
# The joint variable for a joint is the distance from the positive local u axis to the positive local u' axis. It has units of length and is considered positive when in the same direction as the positive local w,w' axes.
# The order in which the two _link names_ appear is arbitrary. This choice, however, does affect the designation of the joint variable (see Note 7 above) and also the signs of the constraint force and torque components within the joint (see the <tt>PRINT FORCE</tt> statement).
# It is assumed that there is no limit on the travel of the joint variable.
# The lead of the screw thread of each <tt>SCREW</tt> joint must be defined by a subsequent <tt>DATA SCREW</tt> statement. Notice that the sign of the lead distinguishes a right-hand from a left-hand thread.
