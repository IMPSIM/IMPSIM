#summary Installing IMP

= Introduction =

IMP is a DOS program and so it needs....DOS to run.  Current operating systems have a few options.

  * Windows 7: Dosbox with a dos extender (dos32a) work fine.
  * Windows XP: IMP works fine with XP's dos mode.  Running in XP in Virtual Box has been confirmed to work as well.
  * Linux: Dosbox and dos32a should work fine here too but this has yet to be tested.

=== Installing ===

  # Download and install Dosbox.  http://www.dosbox.com/
  # Create a folder for dos stuff. Ex: C:\Users\John\dos
  # Download dos extender (dos4gw stand in ) dos32a.
  # Put the extracted dos32a\binw\dos32a.exe into folder you created before C:\Users\John\dos\dos32a.exe
  # Copy dos32a.exe and name the copy dos4gw.exe (also in the dos folder).
  # Download imp.exe and put it in the C:\Users\John\dos folder
  # edit "C:\Users\John\AppData\Local\DOSBox\dosbox-0.74.conf"
