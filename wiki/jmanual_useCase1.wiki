A differential control linkage, which is the kinematic model described in this use case.


This use case describes the flow of events between a modeler and the IMP system as the modeler defines the elements of a kinematic model. For this use case the [Manual_Chapter9 differential control linkage] model from [Manual_Chapter9 chapter 9] is used as an example model. Definition statements are covered in more detail in [Manual_Chapter3 chapter 3] of the IMP user manual.

= Actors =
 _*Modeler*_

   A person using the IMP system to define and analyze a kinematic model.

= Preconditions =
 _*IMP is Running*_

   The IMP system must be operational and ready to accept input for a new kinematic model.
 _*Modeler has Kinematic Model*_

   To ease the definition of the kinematic model in the IMP language, the modeler will have knowledge of the components (such as their names and types) of the kinematic model.

= Alternate Flows =
 _*Syntax Error*_

 If a syntactual error occurs, the system responds by saying that it did not recognize the command and allows the modeler to try again.

 _*Reverse Order*_

 In the above example, the modeler defines the ground and then the joints and links.  The modeler may do this in the reverse order.

= Postconditions =
 _*Kinematic Model Defined*_

   At the conclusion of this use case, the links and joints of the differential control linkage will be defined, albeit without any numerical data such as positions or orientation.
