
The various definition statements recognized by the IMP interpreter are presented in this chapter. The first word of each statement is a keyword instructing the IMP system to interpret the remainder of the statement according to one of the formats on the following pages.

==The &lt;tt&gt;LINK&lt;/tt&gt; Statement==
The &lt;tt&gt;LINK&lt;/tt&gt; statement defines one rigid link of the system.

===Format===
 &lt;tt&gt;LINK&lt;/tt&gt; = link name
where ''link name'' refers to an alphanumeric name given to the link.

===Example===
 &lt;tt&gt;LINK&lt;/tt&gt; = PART
defines a link named ''PART'' to be a part of the system model.

===Notes===
# Use of the &lt;tt&gt;LINK&lt;/tt&gt; statement is optional. Links may also be defined by the use of their ''link name'' in a statement defining a joint.
# If the ''link name'' used in a &lt;tt&gt;LINK&lt;/tt&gt; statement has not been previously defined, a new link is created and assigned that ''link name''.
# No other link may be defined having the same ''link name''. If an attempt is made to do so, no new link results; a warning message is printed instead.
# Each link of the system has attached to it a unique coordinate system which moves whenever the link moves. At the time of its first creation by a &lt;tt&gt;LINK&lt;/tt&gt; statement or a joint definition statement, this link coordinate system is assumed coincident with the global coordinate system. It may be moved to another location or orientation by use of a &lt;tt&gt;DATA LINK&lt;/tt&gt; statement.
# One or more &lt;tt&gt;SHAPE&lt;/tt&gt; statements may be given to provide shape(s) to the link defined with this ''link name''. If such a &lt;tt&gt;SHAPE&lt;/tt&gt; statement is not found, the ''link name'' has no defined shape. Points may still be attached to the link in such a case, however, and their locations may still be defined relative to the link coordinate system. Using such points, a schematic representation may be drawn for the link. However, a solid shape for the link is not known, and collision with other link shapes cannot be detected.
# Each ''link name'' defined must be attached, either directly or indirectly, by properly defined joints to the fixed link. If a ''link name'' does not appear in at least one valid joint definition statement, the &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE HOLD&lt;/tt&gt; statement causes a message to be printed and that link (along with any data dependent on it) to be deleted from the system.


==The &lt;tt&gt;GROUND&lt;/tt&gt; Statement==
The &lt;tt&gt;GROUND&lt;/tt&gt; statement designates the link which remains stationary, that is, the link which contains the global coordinate system.

===Format===
 &lt;tt&gt;GROUND&lt;/tt&gt; = link name
where ''link name'' is the alphanumeric name assigned to the fixed link.

===Example===
 &lt;tt&gt;GROUND&lt;/tt&gt; = FRAME
The link named ''FRAME'' is selected as the fixed link of the system.

===Notes===
# The use of the &lt;tt&gt;GROUND&lt;/tt&gt; statement is optional. Although every IMP simulation model must contain a fixed link, IMP recognizes the name &lt;tt&gt;BASE&lt;/tt&gt; as designating the fixed link unless overridden by a &lt;tt&gt;GROUND&lt;/tt&gt; statement.
# Not more than one ''link name'' may be defined as stationary. If the &lt;tt&gt;GROUND&lt;/tt&gt; statement appears more than once, only the most recent &lt;tt&gt;GROUND&lt;/tt&gt; statement is in effect at any time. Thus, the &lt;tt&gt;GROUND&lt;/tt&gt; statement can be used to perform kinematic inversion.
# All remaining links of the system must be attached by properly defined joints to the fixed link. If a ''link name'' does not appear in at least one valid joint definition statement, the &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE HOLD&lt;/tt&gt; statement causes a message to be printed and the link (and any data dependent on it) to be deleted from the system model.
# Each link of the system has attached to it a unique coordinate system which moves whenever the link moves. At the time of its first creation by a &lt;tt&gt;LINK&lt;/tt&gt; statement or a joint definition statement, this link coordinate system is assumed to be coincident with the global coordinate system. It may be moved to another location or orientation by use of a &lt;tt&gt;DATA LINK&lt;/tt&gt; statement.


==The &lt;tt&gt;SOLID READ&lt;/tt&gt; Statement==
The &lt;tt&gt;SOLID READ&lt;/tt&gt; statement defines one or more solid shapes with data stored in a previously prepared file.

===Format===
 &lt;tt&gt;SOLID READ&lt;/tt&gt; (solid name) = filename
where ''solid name'' refers to the alphanumeric name given to the solid, and ''filename'' is the name of the file containing data for the solid to be read. The file may be in either the JML standard 3-D Solid file format (Appendix A) with ''filename'' extension of ''.geo'', or in the stereo-lithography (&lt;tt&gt;STL&lt;/tt&gt;) standard file format with ''filename'' extension of ''.stl''.

===Example===
 &lt;tt&gt;SOLID READ&lt;/tt&gt; (PART) = shape.geo
defines a solid named ''PART'' with data from a previously prepared JML format file named ''shape.geo''.

===Notes===
# The solid named ''solid name'' defined by ''filename'' is assumed to be attached to the stationary link unless defined otherwise by a subsequent &lt;tt&gt;SHAPE&lt;/tt&gt; statement.
# The data read from the file is assumed referenced to the coordinate system of the link to which the solid is attached unless modified by a subsequent &lt;tt&gt;DATA SHAPE&lt;/tt&gt; statement.
# The ''filename'' used must refer to a previously prepared file containing data for the solid shape; this file must be prepared in either the JML standard 3-D Solid file format (Appendix A) with the ''filename'' extension of ''.geo'', or in the stereo-lithography (&lt;tt&gt;STL&lt;/tt&gt;) standard file format with the ''filename'' extension of ''.stl''. If such a file is not found or cannot be read, no solid is created; a message is printed.
# If the JML standard file format is used it is possible that more than one solid may be contained in the file. If so, multiple solid shapes are created in the system model with ''solid names'' defined in the file. The ''solid name'' defined in the &lt;tt&gt;SOLID READ&lt;/tt&gt; statement will override the ''solid name'' from the file for the first solid shape read.


==The &lt;tt&gt;SHAPE&lt;/tt&gt; Statement==
The &lt;tt&gt;SHAPE&lt;/tt&gt; statement defines a geometry for a link or for one part of a link.

===Format===
 &lt;tt&gt;SHAPE&lt;/tt&gt; (link name) = solid1, solid2, ...
where ''link name'' refers to the alphanumeric name given to the link and each ''solid name'' is the name of a previously defined solid defining the shape of that part of the link.

===Example===
 &lt;tt&gt;SHAPE&lt;/tt&gt; (PART) = bar, ball
defines the shape of a link named ''PART'' to be composed of two previously defined solids named ''bar'' and ''ball''.

===Notes===
# When each solid is first defined by a &lt;tt&gt;SOLID&lt;/tt&gt; statement it is assumed to be part of the fixed link until it is attached to some other link by a &lt;tt&gt;SHAPE&lt;/tt&gt; statement.
# It is necessary to refer to each ''solid name'' in a &lt;tt&gt;SHAPE&lt;/tt&gt; statement for the attachment of that solid to its corresponding ''link name''.
# A maximum of 33 ''solid names'' may be defined in a single &lt;tt&gt;SHAPE&lt;/tt&gt; statement (with continuation lines). There is no restriction, however, on defining additional ''solid names'' attached to the same ''link name'' with one or more additional &lt;tt&gt;SHAPE&lt;/tt&gt; statements.
# If the same ''solid name'' is used in more than one &lt;tt&gt;SHAPE&lt;/tt&gt; statement, the most recent occurrence of that ''solid name'' takes precedence and earlier relationships are replaced.
# Each ''solid name'' may be given a location on the ''link name'' by a subsequent &lt;tt&gt;DATA SHAPE&lt;/tt&gt; statement. If this is not done before an &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE HOLD&lt;/tt&gt; statement is given, then ''shape names'' are defined with their coordinate data measured with respect to the link coordinate system.
# ''Solid names'' attached to different ''link names'' may not be defined in the same &lt;tt&gt;SHAPE&lt;/tt&gt; statement.
# The ''link name'' referred to in a &lt;tt&gt;SHAPE&lt;/tt&gt; statement must have appeared in at least one previous &lt;tt&gt;LINK&lt;/tt&gt; statement or a statement defining a joint. If not, the &lt;tt&gt;SHAPE&lt;/tt&gt; statement is ignored and a message is printed.


==The &lt;tt&gt;CONTACT&lt;/tt&gt; Statement==
The &lt;tt&gt;CONTACT&lt;/tt&gt; statement defines a logical association between two solid shapes of different links which may be monitored for possible collision during the motion of the system.

===Format===
 &lt;tt&gt;CONTACT&lt;/tt&gt; (solid name, solid name) = contact name
where each ''solid name'' refers to the alphanumeric name given to one of the two solid shapes and ''contact name'' is an arbitrarily chosen alphanumeric name assigned to the contact.

===Example===
 &lt;tt&gt;CONTACT&lt;/tt&gt; (KNOB, POCKET) = BUMPER
defines a contact named ''BUMPER'' between two shapes named ''KNOB'' and ''POCKET''.

===Notes===
# &lt;tt&gt;A CONTACT&lt;/tt&gt; statement is never required, but may be useful to form an association between two link shapes of the system such that a possible collision may be detected and proper momentum transfer can be simulated.
# Each contact in the system must be defined by a separate &lt;tt&gt;CONTACT&lt;/tt&gt; statement.
# No other contact may be defined having the same ''contact name''. An attempt to do so results in the deletion of the previously defined contact of the same ''contact name'' (and all data associated with it); a warning message is printed.
# The same ''solid name'' may appear in more than one statement defining a contact.
# Each &lt;tt&gt;CONTACT&lt;/tt&gt; statement must refer to two distinct ''solid names'' of solids on two different links. An attempt to associate a solid shape with itself or with another solid shape on the same link causes the statement to be ignored and a message to be printed.
# The order in which the two ''solid names'' appear is arbitrary.
# Each &lt;tt&gt;CONTACT&lt;/tt&gt; statement should be associated with a corresponding &lt;tt&gt;DATA CONTACT&lt;/tt&gt; statement. If an appropriate &lt;tt&gt;DATA CONTACT&lt;/tt&gt; statement is not defined before an &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE HOLD&lt;/tt&gt; statement is encountered, it is assumed that the coefficient of restitution normal to the surface is unity and all other contact data is zero. No message is printed.


==The &lt;tt&gt;IMPACT&lt;/tt&gt; Statement==
The &lt;tt&gt;IMPACT&lt;/tt&gt; statement is used to specify the nature of the change of momentum equations to be used at the moment of collision between contacting solids defined by &lt;tt&gt;CONTACT&lt;/tt&gt; statements.

===Format===
 &lt;tt&gt;IMPACT&lt;/tt&gt; = ktangent, kmoment, ktorsion
where ''ktangent'', ''kmoment'', and ''ktorsion'' define the types of models to be used for tangential, moment, and torsional impulses, respectively, at modeled contacts; each may be chosen as 0 for undefined, 1 for a coefficient of restitution model, 2 for a Coulomb friction model, or 3 for a bilinear restitution and Coulomb friction model.

; Example: &lt;tt&gt;IMPACT&lt;/tt&gt; = 2, 1, 3
specifies that the mathematical model used for simulating impacts at each &lt;tt&gt;CONTACT&lt;/tt&gt; will be Coulomb friction for any tangential impulses, coefficient of restitution for moment impulses, and bilinear for torsional impulses.

===Notes===
# An &lt;tt&gt;IMPACT&lt;/tt&gt; statement should be defined for any model which includes a &lt;tt&gt;CONTACT&lt;/tt&gt; statement. If this does not appear before the &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE HOLD&lt;/tt&gt; statement, any tangential, moment, or torsional impulses found within contacts are ignored.
# If more than one &lt;tt&gt;IMPACT&lt;/tt&gt; statement is encountered, the later statement takes precedence; earlier data are replaced; no message is printed.
# If integer values other than 0 through 3 are used for ''ktangent'', ''kmoment'', or ''ktorsion'', no error is detected immediately. However 0 is used for the offending value and corresponding impulses are ignored; no message is printed.


==The &lt;tt&gt;RIGID&lt;/tt&gt; Statement==
[[Image:Manual_figure_ch3_1.png|thumb|400px|''Figure 3-1:'' Example of a rigid joint.]]
The &lt;tt&gt;RIGID&lt;/tt&gt; statement defines a non-movable joint connecting two links of the system (see figure 3-1).

===Format===
 &lt;tt&gt;RIGID&lt;/tt&gt; (link name, link name) = joint name
where each ''link name'' refers to the alphanumeric name given to one of the two connected links and ''joint name'' is an arbitrarily chosen alphanumeric name assigned to the joint.

===Example===
 &lt;tt&gt;RIGID&lt;/tt&gt; (LK1, LK2) = WELD
defines a rigid joint named ''WELD'' connecting two links named ''LK1'' and ''LK2''.

===Notes===
# Each rigid joint in the system must be defined by a separate &lt;tt&gt;RIGID&lt;/tt&gt; statement.
# No other joint of any type may be defined having the same ''joint name''. An attempt to do so results in the deletion of the previously defined joint of the same ''joint name'' (and all information dependent on it); a warning message is printed.
# The same ''link name'' may appear in more than one statement defining a joint.
# Each &lt;tt&gt;RIGID&lt;/tt&gt; statement must refer to two distinct ''link names''. An attempt to join a link to itself causes the statement to be ignored and a message to be printed.
# Two local coordinate systems must be chosen for each ''joint name'' (see figure), and defined by a subsequent &lt;tt&gt;DATA RIGID&lt;/tt&gt; statement or by two subsequent &lt;tt&gt;DATA LINK&lt;/tt&gt; statements. One local coordinate system (u,v,w) is rigidly attached to the first ''link name'', while the other (u',v',w') is rigidly attached to the second ''link name''. The two coordinate systems may be located and oriented arbitrarily but both coordinate systems must be coincident (see figure).
# If an appropriate &lt;tt&gt;DATA RIGID&lt;/tt&gt; statement or &lt;tt&gt;DATA LINK&lt;/tt&gt; statement is not defined before an &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE HOLD&lt;/tt&gt; statement is encountered, it is assumed that the corresponding local coordinate systems(s) is (are) coincident with the link coordinate system. No message is printed.
# The &lt;tt&gt;RIGID&lt;/tt&gt; joint is immobile and has no joint variables.
# The order in which the two ''link names'' appear is arbitrary. This choice, however, does affect the signs of the constraint force and torque components within the joint. (See, for example, the &lt;tt&gt;PRINT FORCE&lt;/tt&gt; statement).


==The &lt;tt&gt;XPIN&lt;/tt&gt; Statement==
[[Image:Manual_figure_ch3_2.png|thumb|400px|''Figure 3-2:'' Example of a pinned joint parallel to the X axis.]]
The &lt;tt&gt;XPIN&lt;/tt&gt; statement defines a pinned joint connecting two links of the system (see figure 3-2), with its pin axis initally parallel to the global X axis.

===Format===
 &lt;tt&gt;XPIN&lt;/tt&gt; (link name, link name) = joint name
where each ''link name'' refers to the alphanumeric name given to one of the two connected links and ''joint name'' is an arbitrarily chosen alphanumeric name assigned to the joint.

===Example===
 &lt;tt&gt;XPIN&lt;/tt&gt; (LK1, LK2) = PIN
defines a pinned joint named ''PIN'' connecting two links named ''LK1'' and ''LK2''.

===Notes===
# Each X-oriented pin joint in the system must be defined by a separate &lt;tt&gt;XPIN&lt;/tt&gt; statement.
# No other joint of any type may be defined having the same ''joint name''. An attempt to do so results in the deletion of the previously defined joint of the same ''joint name'' (and all information dependent on it); a warning message is printed.
# The same ''link name'' may appear in more than one statement defining a joint.
# Each statement defining a joint must refer to two distinct ''link names''. An attempt to join a link to itself causes the statement to be ignored and a message to be printed.
# Local coordinate systems must be chosen for each ''joint name'' (see figure), and defined by a subsequent &lt;tt&gt;DATA XPIN&lt;/tt&gt; statement or by two subsequent &lt;tt&gt;DATA LINK&lt;/tt&gt; statements. One local coordinate system (u,v,w) is rigidly attached to the first ''link name'', while the other (u',v',w') is rigidly attached to the second ''link name''. The origins of the two local coordinate systems must be coincident, the local u and u' axes must be collinear and initially parallel to the global X axis and must be directed along the joint axis, and both local u axes must have the same positive sense (see figure).
# If an appropriate &lt;tt&gt;DATA XPIN&lt;/tt&gt; statement or &lt;tt&gt;DATA LINK&lt;/tt&gt; statement is not defined before an &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE HOLD&lt;/tt&gt; statement is encountered, it is assumed that the corresponding local coordinate systems(s) is (are) coincident with the link coordinate system. No message is printed.
# The joint variable for an &lt;tt&gt;XPIN&lt;/tt&gt; joint is the angle from the positive local v axis to the positive local v' axis. It has units of degrees and is considered positive when counterclockwise as seen from the positive local u,u' axes.
# The order in which the two ''link names'' appear is arbitrary. This choice, however, does affect the sign of the joint variable and its derivatives (see Note 7 above) and also the signs of the constraint force and torque components within the joint (see, for example, the &lt;tt&gt;PRINT FORCE&lt;/tt&gt; statement).
# It is assumed that there is no limit on the magnitude of the joint variable (rotation of the joint).


==The &lt;tt&gt;YPIN&lt;/tt&gt; Statement==
[[Image:Manual_figure_ch3_3.png|thumb|400px|''Figure 3-3:'' Example of a pinned joint parallel to the Y axis.]]
The &lt;tt&gt;YPIN&lt;/tt&gt; statement defines a pinned joint connecting two links of the system (see figure 3-3), with
its pin axis initially parallel to the global Y axis.

===Format===
 &lt;tt&gt;YPIN&lt;/tt&gt; (link name, link name) = joint name
where each ''link name'' refers to the alphanumeric name given to one of the two connected links and ''joint name'' is an arbitrarily chosen alphanumeric name assigned to the joint.

===Example===
 &lt;tt&gt;YPIN&lt;/tt&gt; (LK1, LK2) = PIN
defines a pinned joint named ''PIN'' connecting two links named ''LK1'' and ''LK2''.

===Notes===
# Each Y-oriented pin joint in the system must be defined by a separate &lt;tt&gt;YPIN&lt;/tt&gt; statement.
# No other joint of any type may be defined having the same ''joint name''. An attempt to do so results in the deletion of the previously defined joint of the same ''joint name'' (and all information dependent on it); a warning message is printed.
# The same ''link name'' may appear in more than one statement defining a joint.
# Each statement defining a joint must refer to two distinct ''link names''. An attempt to join a link to itself causes the statement to be ignored and a message to be printed.
# Local coordinate systems must be chosen for each ''joint name'' (see figure), and defined by a subsequent &lt;tt&gt;DATA YPIN&lt;/tt&gt; statement or by two subsequent &lt;tt&gt;DATA LINK&lt;/tt&gt; statements. One local coordinate system (u,v,w) is rigidly attached to the first ''link name'', while the other (u',v',w') is rigidly attached to the second ''link name''. The origins of the two local coordinate systems must be coincident, the local v and v' axes must be collinear and initially parallel to the global Y axis and must be directed along the joint axis, and both local v axes must have the same positive sense (see figure).
# If an appropriate &lt;tt&gt;DATA YPIN&lt;/tt&gt; statement or &lt;tt&gt;DATA LINK&lt;/tt&gt; statement is not defined before an &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE HOLD&lt;/tt&gt; statement is encountered, it is assumed that the corresponding local coordinate systems(s) is (are) coincident with the link coordinate system; no message is printed.
# The joint variable for a &lt;tt&gt;YPIN&lt;/tt&gt; joint is the angle from the positive local w axis to the positive local w' axis. It has units of degrees and is considered positive when counterclockwise as seen from the positive local v,v' axes.
# The order in which the two ''link names'' appear is arbitrary. This choice, however, does affect the sign of the joint variable and its derivatives (see Note 7 above) and also the signs of the constraint force and torque components within the joint (see, for example, the &lt;tt&gt;PRINT FORCE&lt;/tt&gt; statement).
# It is assumed that there is no limit on the magnitude of the joint variable (rotation of the joint).


==The &lt;tt&gt;ZPIN&lt;/tt&gt; Statement==
[[Image:Manual_figure_ch3_4.png|thumb|400px|''Figure 3-4:'' Example of a pinned joint parallel to the Z axis.]]
The &lt;tt&gt;ZPIN&lt;/tt&gt; statement defines a pinned joint connecting two links of the system (see figure 3-4), with
its pin axis initially parallel to the global Z axis.

===Format===
 &lt;tt&gt;ZPIN&lt;/tt&gt; (link name, link name) = joint name
where each ''link name'' refers to the alphanumeric name given to one of the two connected links and ''joint name'' is an arbitrarily chosen alphanumeric name assigned to the joint.

===Example===
 &lt;tt&gt;ZPIN&lt;/tt&gt; (LK1, LK2) = PIN
defines a pinned joint named ''PIN'' connecting two links named ''LK1'' and ''LK2''.

===Notes===
# Each Z-oriented pin joint in the system must be defined by a separate &lt;tt&gt;ZPIN&lt;/tt&gt; statement.
# No other joint of any type may be defined having the same ''joint name''. An attempt to do so results in the deletion of the previously defined joint of the same ''joint name'' (and all information dependent on it); a warning message is printed.
# The same ''link name'' may appear in more than one statement defining a joint.
# Each statement defining a joint must refer to two distinct ''link names''. An attempt to join a link to itself causes the statement to be ignored and a message to be printed.
# Local coordinate systems must be chosen for each ''joint name'' (see figure), and defined by a subsequent &lt;tt&gt;DATA ZPIN&lt;/tt&gt; statement or by two subsequent &lt;tt&gt;DATA LINK&lt;/tt&gt; statements. One local coordinate system (u,v,w) is rigidly attached to the first ''link name'', while the other (u',v',w') is rigidly attached to the second ''link name''. The origins of the two local coordinate systems must be coincident, the local w and w' axes must be collinear and initially parallel to the global Z axis and must be directed along the joint axis, and both local w axes must have the same positive sense (see figure).
# If an appropriate &lt;tt&gt;DATA ZPIN&lt;/tt&gt; statement or &lt;tt&gt;DATA LINK&lt;/tt&gt; statement is not defined before an &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE HOLD&lt;/tt&gt; statement is encountered, it is assumed that the corresponding local coordinate systems(s) is (are) coincident with the link coordinate system. No message is printed.
# The joint variable for a &lt;tt&gt;ZPIN&lt;/tt&gt; joint is the angle from the positive local u axis to the positive local u' axis. It has units of degrees and is considered positive when counterclockwise as seen from the positive local w,w' axes.
# The order in which the two ''link names'' appear is arbitrary. This choice, however, does affect the sign of the joint variable and its derivatives (see Note 7 above) and also the signs of the constraint force and torque components within the joint (see, for example, the &lt;tt&gt;PRINT FORCE&lt;/tt&gt; statement).
# It is assumed that there is no limit on the magnitude of the joint variable (rotation of the joint).


==The &lt;tt&gt;REVOLUTE&lt;/tt&gt; Statement==
[[Image:Manual_figure_ch3_5.png|thumb|400px|''Figure 3-5:'' Example of a pin joint connecting two links.]]
The &lt;tt&gt;REVOLUTE&lt;/tt&gt; statement defines a pin joint connecting two links of the system (see figure 3-5).

===Format===
 &lt;tt&gt;REVOLUTE&lt;/tt&gt; (link name, link name) = joint name
where each ''link name'' refers to the alphanumeric name given to one of the two connected links and ''joint name'' is an arbitrarily chosen alphanumeric name assigned to the joint.

===Example===
 &lt;tt&gt;REVOLUTE&lt;/tt&gt; (LK1, LK2) = PIN
defines a pinned joint named ''PIN'' connecting two links named ''LK1'' and ''LK2''.

===Notes===
# Each revolute joint in the system must be defined by a separate &lt;tt&gt;REVOLUTE&lt;/tt&gt; statement.
# No other joint of any type may be defined having the same ''joint name''. An attempt to do so results in the deletion of the previously defined joint of the same ''joint name'' (and all information dependent on it); a warning message is printed.
# The same ''link name'' may appear in more than one statement defining a joint.
# Each &lt;tt&gt;REVOLUTE&lt;/tt&gt; statement defining a joint must refer to two distinct ''link names''. An attempt to join a link to itself causes the statement to be ignored and a message to be printed.
# Two local coordinate systems must be chosen for each ''joint name'' (see figure), and defined by a subsequent &lt;tt&gt;DATA REVOLUTE&lt;/tt&gt; statement or by two subsequent &lt;tt&gt;DATA LINK&lt;/tt&gt; statements. One local coordinate system (u,v,w) is rigidly attached to the first ''link name'', while the other (u',v',w') is rigidly attached to the second ''link name''. The origins of the two local coordinate systems must be coincident the local w and w' axes must be collinear and must be directed along the joint axis and both local w axes must have the same positive sense (see figure).
# If an appropriate &lt;tt&gt;DATA REVOLUTE&lt;/tt&gt; statement or &lt;tt&gt;DATA LINK&lt;/tt&gt; statement is not defined before an &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE HOLD&lt;/tt&gt; statement is encountered, it is assumed that the corresponding local coordinate systems(s) is (are) coincident with the link coordinate system; no message is printed.
# The joint variable for a &lt;tt&gt;REVOLUTE&lt;/tt&gt; joint is the angle from the positive local u axis to the positive local u' axis. It has units of degrees and is considered positive when counterclockwise as seen from the positive local w,w' axes.
# The order in which the two ''link names'' appear is arbitrary. This choice, however, does affect the sign of the joint variable and its derivatives (see Note 7 above) and also the signs of the constraint force and torque components within the joint (see, for example, the &lt;tt&gt;PRINT FORCE&lt;/tt&gt; statement).
# It is assumed that there is no limit on the magnitude of the joint variable (rotation of the joint).


==The &lt;tt&gt;XSLIDE&lt;/tt&gt; Statement==
[[Image:Manual_figure_ch3_6.png|thumb|400px|''Figure 3-6:'' Example of a sliding joint with its axis parallel to the X axis.]]
The &lt;tt&gt;XSLIDE&lt;/tt&gt; statement defines a sliding joint connecting two links of the system (see figure 3-6), with its axis initially parallel to the global X axis.

===Format===
 &lt;tt&gt;XSLIDE&lt;/tt&gt; (link name, link name) = joint name
where each ''link name'' refers to the alphanumeric name given to one of the two connected links and ''joint name'' is an arbitrarily chosen alphanumeric name assigned to the joint.

===Example===
 &lt;tt&gt;XSLIDE&lt;/tt&gt; (LK1, LK2) = SLIP
defines a sliding joint named ''SLIP'' connecting two links named ''LK1'' and ''LK2''.

===Notes===
# Each X-oriented sliding joint in the system must be defined by a separate &lt;tt&gt;XSLIDE&lt;/tt&gt; statement.
# No other joint of any type may be defined having the same ''joint name''. An attempt to do so results in the deletion of the previously defined joint of the same ''joint name'' (and all information dependent on it); a warning message is printed.

# The first ''link name'' must be that of the rack, and the second ''link name'' refers to the pinion link the order is not arbitrary and cannot be reversed.
# Two local coordinate systems must be chosen for each ''joint name'' (see figure), and defined by two subsequent &lt;tt&gt;DATA LINK&lt;/tt&gt; statements. One local coordinate system (u,v,w) is rigidly attached to the first ''link name'', while the other (u',v',w') is rigidly attached to the second ''link name''. The local u axis must lie in the plane of the pitch circle of the pinion, along the pitch line of the rack, while the local w axis is perpendicular to the plane of the pitch circle and the local v axis is in the plane of the pitch circle and positively directed toward the pinion side of u.

# It is assumed that there is no limit on the travel of the joint variable.
# The pitch circle radius of the pinion must be defined by a subsequent &lt;tt&gt;DATA RACK&lt;/tt&gt; statement.
# The simulation of a &lt;tt&gt;RACK&lt;/tt&gt; joint is treated as though the pinion is a cylinder rolling without slip against a smooth plane for the rack. This causes no problem in motion analysis; however, in force analysis, the pinion is treated as having zero pressure angle.

One local coordinate system (u,v,w) is rigidly attached to the first ''link name'', while the other (u',v',w') is rigidly attached to the second ''link name''. The local w and w' axes must both lie normal to the plane of the pitch curve and both must be positively directed on the same side of this plane. The local u,v and u',v' axes must all lie in this same plane; the (u,v,w) local origin may be located arbitrarily on the first ''link name'' but the (u',v',w') local origin must be located on the pitch curve. The line directed from the origin of (u,v,w) to the origin of (u',v',w') is defined as positive t (see figure).

 &lt;tt&gt;SLOT&lt;/tt&gt; (PLAT, BAR) = CURV
defines a &lt;tt&gt;SLOT&lt;/tt&gt; joint named ''CURV'' connecting a profile slotted link named ''PLAT'' with a follower link named ''BAR''.

===Notes===
# Each slot joint in the system must be defined by a separate &lt;tt&gt;SLOT&lt;/tt&gt; statement.
# No other joint of any type may be defined having the same ''joint name''. An attempt to do so results in the deletion of the previously defined joint of the same ''joint name'' (and all information dependent on it); a message is printed.
# The same ''link name'' may appear in more than one statement defining a joint.
# Each statement defining a joint must refer to two distinct ''link names''. An attempt to join a link to itself causes the statement to be ignored and a message to be printed.
# The first ''link name'' referenced must be that containing the slot profile and the second ''link name'' refers to the follower link; the order is not arbitrary and cannot be reversed.
# Two local coordinate systems must be chosen for each ''joint name'' (see figure), and defined by two subsequent &lt;tt&gt;DATA LINK&lt;/tt&gt; statements. One local coordinate system (u,v,w) is rigidly attached to the first ''link name'', while the other (u',v',w') is rigidly attached to the second ''link name''. The local w and w' axes must both lie normal to the plane of the profiled slot and both must be positively directed on the same side of the plane. The local u,v and u',v' axes must all lie in this same plane the (u,v,w) local origin may be located arbitrarily on the first ''link name'', but the (u',v',w') local origin must be located on the centerline of the profiled slot (see figure).
# If an appropriate &lt;tt&gt;DATA LINK&lt;/tt&gt; statement is not defined before the &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE HOLD&lt;/tt&gt; statement is encountered, it is assumed the corresponding local coordinate system(s) is (are) coincident with the link coordinate system; no message is printed.
# A &lt;tt&gt;SLOT&lt;/tt&gt; joint has two internal degrees of freedom. The first joint variable is the u projection of the distance from the first local coordinate origin to the second local coordinate origin it has units of length and is considered positive if in the same direction as the positive local u axis. The second joint variable is the angle from a line paralleling the positive local u axis to the positive local u' axis it has units of degrees and considered positive when counterclockwise as seen from the positive local w' axis.
# It is assumed there are no limits on the travel of either joint variable (see notes for the &lt;tt&gt;DATA SLOT&lt;/tt&gt; statement).
# The shape of the profiled slot in the first ''link name'' must be defined by a subsequent &lt;tt&gt;DATA SLOT&lt;/tt&gt; statement.


==The &lt;tt&gt;CYLINDER&lt;/tt&gt; Statement==
[[Image:Manual_figure_ch3_16.png|thumb|400px|''Figure 3-16:'' Example of a cylindric joint connecting two links.]]
The &lt;tt&gt;CYLINDER&lt;/tt&gt; statement defines a cylindric joint (allowing turning and sliding motions about and along a common axis) connecting two links of the system (see figure 3-16).

===Format===
 &lt;tt&gt;CYLINDER&lt;/tt&gt; (link name, link name) = joint name
where each ''link name'' refers to the alphanumeric name given to one of the two connected links and ''joint name'' is an arbitrarily chosen alphanumeric name assigned to the joint.

===Example===
 &lt;tt&gt;CYLINDER&lt;/tt&gt; (LK1, LK2) = CYL
defines a cylindric joint named ''CYL'' connecting two links named ''LK1'' and ''LK2''.

===Notes===
# Each cylindric joint in the system must be defined by a separate &lt;tt&gt;CYLINDER&lt;/tt&gt; statement.
# No other joint of any type may be defined having the same ''joint name''. An attempt to do so results in the deletion of the previously defined joint of the same ''joint name'' (and all information dependent on it) a message is printed.
# The same ''link name'' may appear in more than one statement defining a joint.
# Each statement defining a joint must refer to two distinct ''link names''. An attempt to join a link to itself causes the statement to be ignored and a message to be printed.
# Two local coordinate systems must be chosen for each &lt;tt&gt;CYLINDER&lt;/tt&gt; ''joint name'' (see figure) and defined by a subsequent &lt;tt&gt;DATA CYLINDER&lt;/tt&gt; statement or by two subsequent &lt;tt&gt;DATA LINK&lt;/tt&gt; statements. One local coordinate system (u,v,w) is rigidly attached to the first ''link name'', while the other (u',v',w') is rigidly attached to the second ''link name''. The local w and w' axes must be collinear and must be directed along the axis of relative motion of the joint. Both local w axes must have the same positive sense (see figure).
# If an appropriate &lt;tt&gt;DATA CYLINDER&lt;/tt&gt; statement or &lt;tt&gt;DATA LINK&lt;/tt&gt; statement is not defined before an &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE HOLD&lt;/tt&gt; statement is encountered, it is assumed that the corresponding local coordinate system(s) is (are) coincident with the link coordinate system; no message is printed.
# Each &lt;tt&gt;CYLINDER&lt;/tt&gt; joint has two internal degrees of freedom. The first joint variable is the angle from the positive local u axis to the positive local u' axis. It has units of degrees and is considered positive when counterclockwise as seen from the positive local w,w' axes. The second joint variable is the distance from the local u axis to the local u' axis measured along the common local w,w' axes it has units of length and is considered positive when the relative displacement is in the same sense as the positive local w,w' axes.
# The order in which the two ''link names'' appear is arbitrary. This choice, however, does affect the designation of the joint variables (see Note 7 above) and also the signs of the constraint force and torque components within the joint (see the &lt;tt&gt;PRINT FORCE&lt;/tt&gt; statement).
# It is assumed that there is no limit on the travel of either joint variable.


==The &lt;tt&gt;UJOINT&lt;/tt&gt; Statement==
[[Image:Manual_figure_ch3_17.png|thumb|400px|''Figure 3-17:'' Example of a universal joint connecting two links.]]
The &lt;tt&gt;UJOINT&lt;/tt&gt; statement defines a Hooke universal joint connecting two links of the system (see figure 3-17).

===Format===
 &lt;tt&gt;UJOINT&lt;/tt&gt; (link name, link name) = joint name
where each ''link name'' refers to the alphanumeric name given to one of the two connected links and ''joint name'' is an arbitrarily chosen alphanumeric name assigned to the joint.

===Example===
 &lt;tt&gt;UJOINT&lt;/tt&gt; (SHFT, ROD) = UJNT
defines a Hooke universal joint named ''UJNT'' connecting two links named ''SHFT'' and ''ROD''.

===Notes===
# Each universal joint in the system must be defined by a separate &lt;tt&gt;UJOINT&lt;/tt&gt; statement.
# No other joint of any type may be defined having the same ''joint name''. An attempt to do so results in the deletion of the previously defined joint of the same ''joint name'' (and all information dependent on it) a message is printed.
# The same ''link name'' may appear in more than one statement defining a joint.
# Each statement defining a joint must refer to two distinct ''link names''. An attempt to join a link to itself causes the statement to be ignored and a message to be printed.
# Two local coordinate systems must be chosen for each &lt;tt&gt;UJOINT&lt;/tt&gt; ''joint name'' (see figure) and defined by a subsequent &lt;tt&gt;DATA UJOINT&lt;/tt&gt; statement or by two subsequent &lt;tt&gt;DATA LINK&lt;/tt&gt; statements. One local coordinate system (u,v,w) is rigidly attached to the first ''link name'', while the other (u',v',w') is rigidly attached to the second ''link name''. The origins of the two local coordinate systems must be coincident; the local w and w' axes must coincide with the two pin axes on the cross of the universal joint and they must be mutually perpendicular. The common perpendicular to the local w and w' axes is defined as t and is positive in the direction specified by the right hand rule applied from positive w to positive w' (see figure).
# If an appropriate &lt;tt&gt;DATA UJOINT&lt;/tt&gt; statement or &lt;tt&gt;DATA LINK&lt;/tt&gt; statement is not defined before an &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE HOLD&lt;/tt&gt; statement is encountered, it is assumed that the corresponding local coordinate system(s) is (are) coincident with the link coordinate system; no message is printed.
# A &lt;tt&gt;UJOINT&lt;/tt&gt; joint has two internal degrees of freedom. The first joint variable is the angle from the positive local u axis to positive t it has units of degrees and is considered positive when counterclockwise as seen from positive w. The second joint variable is the angle from positive t to the positive local u' axis it also has units of degrees and is considered positive when counterclockwise as seen from the positive w' axis.
# The order in which the two ''link names'' appear is arbitrary. This choice, however, does affect the designation of the joint variables (see Note 7 above) and also the signs of the constraint force and torque components within the joint (see the &lt;tt&gt;PRINT FORCE&lt;/tt&gt; statement).
# It is assumed that there is no limit on the rotation of either of the joint variables.


==The &lt;tt&gt;FLAT&lt;/tt&gt; Statement==
[[Image:Manual_figure_ch3_18.png|thumb|400px|''Figure 3-18:'' Example of a flat joint connecting two links.]]
The &lt;tt&gt;FLAT&lt;/tt&gt; statement defines a flat joint (two flat surfaces constrained to remain in contact but free to turn and slide in the plane) connecting two links of the system (see figure 3-18).

===Format===
 &lt;tt&gt;FLAT&lt;/tt&gt; (link name, link name) = joint name
where each ''link name'' refers to the alphanumeric name given to one of the two connected links and ''joint name'' is an arbitrarily chosen alphanumeric name assigned to the joint.

===Example===
 &lt;tt&gt;FLAT&lt;/tt&gt; (BASE, PAD) = PLATE
defines a &lt;tt&gt;FLAT&lt;/tt&gt; joint named ''PLATE'' connecting two links named ''BASE'' and ''PAD''.

===Notes===
# Each flat joint in the system must be defined by a separate &lt;tt&gt;FLAT&lt;/tt&gt; statement.
# No other joint of any type may be defined having the same ''joint name''. An attempt to do so results in the deletion of the previously defined joint of the same ''joint name'' (and all information dependent on it); a message is printed.
# The same ''link name'' may appear in more than one statement defining a joint.
# Each statement defining a joint must refer to two distinct ''link names''. An attempt to join a link to itself causes the statement to be ignored and a message to be printed.
# Two local coordinate systems must be chosen for each &lt;tt&gt;FLAT&lt;/tt&gt; ''joint name'' (see figure), and defined by two subsequent &lt;tt&gt;DATA LINK&lt;/tt&gt; statements. One local coordinate system (u,v,w) is rigidly attached to the first ''link name'', while the other (u',v',w') is rigidly attached to the second ''link name''. The u,v and u',v' planes must be chosen coplanar and parallel to the mating surfaces of the joint the local w and w' axes must be parallel and must be directed to the same side of the mating surfaces (see figure).
# Care should be taken in choosing the two local coordinate systems to insure that, as the joint moves, the origins of the two local coordinate systems never become coincident. If these origins do become coincident the first and third joint variables become redundant (see note 8 below, and see figure); numeric difficulties may be encountered at or very near to such a position.
# If an appropriate &lt;tt&gt;DATA LINK&lt;/tt&gt; statement is not defined before an &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE HOLD&lt;/tt&gt; statement is encountered it is assumed that the corresponding local coordinate system(s) is (are) coincident with the link coordinate system; no message is printed.
# &lt;tt&gt;A FLAT&lt;/tt&gt; joint has three internal degrees of freedom. The common perpendicular between the local w and w' axes is designated as t. The first joint variable is the angle from the positive local u axis to positive t; it has units of degrees and is considered positive when counterclockwise as seen from positive local w. The second joint variable is the distance from w to w' measured along t; it has units of length and is considered positive when measured in the same sense as positive t. The third joint variable is the angle from positive t to positive local u'; it has units of degrees and is considered positive when counterclockwise as seen from the positive local w' axis (see figure).
# The order in which the two ''link names'' appear is arbitrary. This choice, however, does affect the designation of the joint variables (see Note 8 above) and also the signs of the constraint force and torque components within the joint (see the &lt;tt&gt;PRINT FORCE&lt;/tt&gt; statement).

==The &lt;tt&gt;PLANE&lt;/tt&gt; Statement==
[[Image:Manual_figure_ch3_19.png|thumb|400px|''Figure 3-19:'' Example of a planar joint connecting two links.]]
The &lt;tt&gt;PLANE&lt;/tt&gt; statement defines a planar joint (two flat surfaces constrained to remain in contact but free to turn and slide in the plane) connecting two links of the system (see figure 3-19).

===Format===
 &lt;tt&gt;PLANE&lt;/tt&gt; (link name, link name) = joint name
where each ''link name'' refers to the alphanumeric name given to one of the two connected links and ''joint name'' is an arbitrarily chosen alphanumeric name assigned to the joint.

===Example===
 &lt;tt&gt;PLANE&lt;/tt&gt; (BASE, PAD) = PLATE
defines a planar joint named ''PLATE'' connecting two links named ''BASE'' and ''PAD''.

===Notes===
# Each planar joint in the system must be defined by a separate &lt;tt&gt;PLANE&lt;/tt&gt; statement.

# &lt;tt&gt;A PLANE&lt;/tt&gt; joint has three internal degrees of freedom. The first and second joint variables are the u and v components, respectively, of the location of the (u',v',w') origin with respect to the (u,v,w) axes. These have units of length and are considered positive according to the sense of the u and v axes. The third joint variable is the angle from a line parallel to the positive local u axis to the positive local u' axis it has units of degrees and is considered positive when counterclockwise as seen from the positive local w' axis (see figure).

==The &lt;tt&gt;SPHERE&lt;/tt&gt; Statement==
[[Image:Manual_figure_ch3_20.png|thumb|400px|''Figure 3-20:'' Example of a ball and socket joint connecting two links.]]
[[Image:Manual_figure_ch3_21.png|thumb|400px|''Figure 3-21:'' Kinematically equivalent model of a ball and socket joint connecting two links.]]
The &lt;tt&gt;SPHERE&lt;/tt&gt; statement defines a ball and socket joint connecting two links of the system (see figure 3-20, 3-21).

===Format===
 &lt;tt&gt;SPHERE&lt;/tt&gt; (link name, link name) = joint name
where each ''link name'' refers to the alphanumeric name given to one of the two connected links and ''joint name'' is an arbitrarily chosen alphanumeric name assigned to the joint.

===Example===
 &lt;tt&gt;SPHERE&lt;/tt&gt; (BALL, SCKT) = SPHR
defines a spheric joint named ''SPHR'' connecting two links named ''BALL'' and ''SCKT''.

===Notes===
# Each spheric joint in the system must be defined by a separate &lt;tt&gt;SPHERE&lt;/tt&gt; statement.
# No other joint of any type may be defined having the same ''joint name''. An attempt to do so results in the deletion of the previously defined joint of the same ''joint name'' (and all information dependent on it); a message is printed.
# The same ''link name'' may appear in more than one statement defining a joint.
# Each statement defining a joint must refer to two distinct ''link names''. An attempt to join a link to itself causes the statement to be ignored and a message to be printed.
# Two local coordinate systems must be chosen for each &lt;tt&gt;SPHERE&lt;/tt&gt; ''joint name'' (see figure), and defined by a subsequent &lt;tt&gt;DATA SPHERE&lt;/tt&gt; statement or by two subsequent &lt;tt&gt;DATA LINK&lt;/tt&gt; statements. One local coordinate system (u,v,w) is rigidly attached to the first ''link name'', while the other (u',v',w') is rigidly attached to the second ''link name''. The origins of the two local coordinate systems must be coincident with the center of the spheric joint. Care should be taken in choosing the coordinate systems such that, as the joint moves, the local u and w' axes never become collinear. If these axes do become collinear, the first and third joint variables become redundant (see Note 8 below, and see figure). Numeric difficulties may be encountered at or very near to such a position.
# If an appropriate &lt;tt&gt;DATA SPHERE&lt;/tt&gt; statement or &lt;tt&gt;DATA LINK&lt;/tt&gt; statement is not defined before an &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE HOLD&lt;/tt&gt; statement is encountered it is assumed that the corresponding local coordinate system(s) is (are) coincident with the link coordinate system; no message is printed.
# A spheric joint has three internal degrees of freedom. The three joint variables are the three Eulerian angles describing the relative orientation of the local coordinate systems (see figure). All three joint variables have units of degrees and are considered positive when counterclockwise as seen from the positive ends of the local u axis, the line of nodes, and the local w' axis, respectively.
# The order in which the two ''link names'' appear is arbitrary. This choice, however, does affect the designation of the joint variables (see Note 7 above) and also the signs of the constraint force and torque components within the joint (see the &lt;tt&gt;PRINT FORCE&lt;/tt&gt; statement).
# It is assumed that there are no limits on the rotations of any of the joint variables.


==The &lt;tt&gt;OPEN&lt;/tt&gt; Statement==
[[Image:Manual_figure_ch3_22.png|thumb|400px|''Figure 3-22:'' Example of a logical association between two links without physical constraints.]]
The &lt;tt&gt;OPEN&lt;/tt&gt; statement defines a logical association between two links of the system without producing any physical constraints (see figure 3-22).

===Format===
 &lt;tt&gt;OPEN&lt;/tt&gt; (link name, link name) = joint name
where each ''link name'' refers to the alphanumeric name given to one of the two associated links and ''joint name'' is an arbitrarily chosen alphanumeric name assigned to the joint.

===Example===
 &lt;tt&gt;OPEN&lt;/tt&gt; (BASE, BALL) = FREE
defines a logical association named ''FREE'' between two links named ''BASE'' and ''BALL''.

===Notes===
# An &lt;tt&gt;OPEN&lt;/tt&gt; statement is never required, but may be useful to form an association between two links of the system such that, for example, some of the variables can be driven with a prescribed motion while others remain free.
# No other joint of any type may be defined having the same ''joint name''. An attempt to do so results in the deletion of the previously defined joint of the same ''joint name'' (and all information dependent on it); a message is printed.
# The same ''link name'' may appear in more than one statement defining a joint.
# Each statement defining a joint must refer to two distinct ''link names''. An attempt to join a link to itself causes the statement to be ignored and a message to be printed.
# Two local coordinate systems must be chosen for each &lt;tt&gt;OPEN&lt;/tt&gt; ''joint name'' (see figure) and defined by two subsequent &lt;tt&gt;DATA LINK&lt;/tt&gt; statements. One local coordinate system (u,v,w) is rigidly attached to the first ''link name'', while the other (u',v',w') is rigidly attached to the second ''link name''. Care should be taken in choosing the coordinate systems such that, as the joint moves, the local u and w' axes never become parallel. If these axes do become parallel the fourth and sixth joint variables become redundant (see note 7 below, and see figure). Numeric difficulties may be encountered at or very near to such a position.
# If an appropriate &lt;tt&gt;DATA LINK&lt;/tt&gt; statement is not defined before an &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE HOLD&lt;/tt&gt; statement is encountered it is assumed that the corresponding local coordinate system(s) is (are) coincident with the link coordinate system; no message is printed.
# An &lt;tt&gt;OPEN&lt;/tt&gt; joint has six internal degrees of freedom. The first three joint variables are the u, v, and w components of the location (translation) of the u',v',w' local origin with respect to the u,v,w axes, respectively. These three variables have units of length and are considered positive according to the senses of the positive local u, v, and w axes. The final three joint variables are the three Eulerian angles describing the relative orientation of the local These three angles are coordinate systems (see figure). defined identically to those of the &lt;tt&gt;SPHERE&lt;/tt&gt; statement.
# The order in which the two ''link names'' appear is arbitrary. This choice, however, does affect the designation of the joint variables (see Note 7 above), and also the signs of the constraint force and torque components within the joint (see the &lt;tt&gt;PRINT FORCE&lt;/tt&gt; statement).
# It is assumed that there are no limits on the travel of any of the joint variables.


==The &lt;tt&gt;POINT&lt;/tt&gt; Statement==
The &lt;tt&gt;POINT&lt;/tt&gt; statement defines one or more points of interest attached to one link of the system model. This statement can also be used to define lines to be drawn by the &lt;tt&gt;DRAW&lt;/tt&gt; statement.

===Format===
 &lt;tt&gt;POINT&lt;/tt&gt; (link name) = point name, point name, point name, ...
where ''link name'' is the alphanumeric name of the link to which the points are attached and each ''point name'' is an arbitrarily selected alphanumeric name for one of the points being defined. If more than one ''point name'' is listed, the order of the ''point names'' also defines a series of straight line segments to be drawn by subsequent &lt;tt&gt;DRAW&lt;/tt&gt; statements.

; Examples
: &lt;tt&gt;POINT&lt;/tt&gt; (LEVR) = PT1
: &lt;tt&gt;POINT&lt;/tt&gt; (BASE) = A, B, P, PT2, Q
These two statements define a point named ''PT1'' attached to a link named ''LEVR'', and five points named ''A'', ''B'', ''P'', ''PT2'', and ''Q'' attached to another link named ''BASE''. If a &lt;tt&gt;DRAW&lt;/tt&gt; statement is issued, the above statements cause no lines to be drawn for link ''LEVR''; however, the link named ''BASE'' will be drawn as a series of straight line segments from ''A'' to ''B'' to ''P'' to ''PT2'' to ''Q''.

===Notes===
# Each point to be referenced by its ''point name'' in an IMP model must be defined by a &lt;tt&gt;POINT&lt;/tt&gt; statement.
# It is necessary to define ''point names'' for the attachment points of every spring or damper, for the points of application of every force, and to define the direction of every force or torque. Also, it is often useful to define ''point names'' so that their motions can be printed, so that their locations can be used in supplying data, or to control the visible outline of a link when using the &lt;tt&gt;DRAW&lt;/tt&gt; statement.
# A maximum of 33 ''point names'' may be defined in a single &lt;tt&gt;POINT&lt;/tt&gt; statement (with continuation lines). There is no restriction, however, on defining additional ''point names'' attached to the same ''link name'' with one or more additional &lt;tt&gt;POINT&lt;/tt&gt; statements.
# The same ''point name'' may be used more than once, either in the same or in different &lt;tt&gt;POINT&lt;/tt&gt; statements. This is often useful when defining a closed figure for the &lt;tt&gt;DRAW&lt;/tt&gt; statement. If the same ''point name'' is defined on more than one link, the first occurrence of that ''point name'' is treated as primary and used for the attachment point of a spring, for example, if requested.
# Each different ''point name'' must be given a location on the ''link name'' by a subsequent &lt;tt&gt;DATA POINT&lt;/tt&gt; statement. If this is not done before an &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE HOLD&lt;/tt&gt; statement is given, those ''point names'' with missing data are placed coincident with the global origin; no message is printed.
# ''Point names'' attached to different ''link names'' may not be defined in the same &lt;tt&gt;POINT&lt;/tt&gt; statement.
# There is no restriction against attaching one or more ''point names'' to the stationary ''link name''.
# The ''link name'' referred to in a &lt;tt&gt;POINT&lt;/tt&gt; statement must have appeared in at least one previous &lt;tt&gt;SHAPE&lt;/tt&gt; statement or a statement defining a joint. If not, the &lt;tt&gt;POINT&lt;/tt&gt; statement is ignored and a message is printed.
# The vertices of a link shape defined by a filename in a &lt;tt&gt;SHAPE&lt;/tt&gt; statement have no associated ''point name'' and cannot be referenced as points. An additional coincident point may be defined for this purpose, however, by a &lt;tt&gt;POINT&lt;/tt&gt; statement.

==The &lt;tt&gt;SPRING&lt;/tt&gt; Statement==
The &lt;tt&gt;SPRING&lt;/tt&gt; statement defines a spring connecting two points of the system.

===Format===
 &lt;tt&gt;SPRING&lt;/tt&gt; (point name, point name) = spring name
where each ''point name'' is the alphanumeric name of one of the two points to which the ends of the spring are attached, and ''spring name'' is an arbitrarily selected alphanumeric name assigned to the spring.

===Example===
 &lt;tt&gt;SPRING&lt;/tt&gt; (PT1, PT2) = PULL
defines a spring named ''PULL'' connected between two points named ''PT1'' and ''PT2''.

===Notes===
# Each spring not acting within a joint (see &lt;tt&gt;DATA SPRING&lt;/tt&gt; statement) must be defined by a separate &lt;tt&gt;SPRING&lt;/tt&gt; statement.
# Defining a spring as acting within a joint (see &lt;tt&gt;DATA SPRING&lt;/tt&gt; statement) is preferable to use of the &lt;tt&gt;SPRING&lt;/tt&gt; statement when possible; the numerical accuracy is better and efficiency is much improved.
# No two springs may be defined having the same ''spring name''. An attempt to do so results in the deletion of the previously defined spring with the same ''spring name'' (and associated data) and causes a message to be printed.
# The two ''point names'' used may not be identical; if identical ''point names'' are used the &lt;tt&gt;SPRING&lt;/tt&gt; statement is ignored and a message is printed.
# The two ''point names'' used must have been defined by previous &lt;tt&gt;POINT&lt;/tt&gt; statements. If not, the &lt;tt&gt;SPRING&lt;/tt&gt; statement is ignored and a message is printed.
# Each spring defined by a &lt;tt&gt;SPRING&lt;/tt&gt; statement must be further characterized by a subsequent &lt;tt&gt;DATA SPRING&lt;/tt&gt; statement. If a &lt;tt&gt;DATA SPRING&lt;/tt&gt; statement does not appear for each ''spring name'' before an &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE HOLD&lt;/tt&gt; statement is given then any ''spring name'' with missing data is deleted at that time; a message is printed.
# Care should be taken to insure that, as the system moves, the two end points of the spring are never located at the same position since, in such a case, the direction of the spring force becomes undefined. If this does occur during the simulation, the effect of that spring is ignored for that position; a message is printed.


==The &lt;tt&gt;DAMPER&lt;/tt&gt; Statement==
The &lt;tt&gt;DAMPER&lt;/tt&gt; statement defines a viscous damper (dashpot) connecting two points of the system.

===Format===
 &lt;tt&gt;DAMPER&lt;/tt&gt; (point name, point name) = damper name
where each ''point name'' is the alphanumeric name of one of the two points to which the ends of the damper are attached and ''damper name'' is an arbitrarily selected alphanumeric name assigned to the damper.

===Example===
 &lt;tt&gt;DAMPER&lt;/tt&gt; (PT1, PT2) = SLOW
defines a viscous damper named ''SLOW'' connected between two points named ''PT1'' and ''PT2''.

===Notes===
# Each damper not acting within a joint (see &lt;tt&gt;DATA DAMPER&lt;/tt&gt; statement) must be defined by a separate &lt;tt&gt;DAMPER&lt;/tt&gt; statement.
# Defining a damper as acting within a joint (see &lt;tt&gt;DATA DAMPER&lt;/tt&gt; statement) is preferable to use of the &lt;tt&gt;DAMPER&lt;/tt&gt; statement when possible; the numerical accuracy is better and efficiency is much improved.
# No two viscous dampers may be defined having the same ''damper name''. An attempt to do so results in the deletion of the previously defined damper with the same ''damper name'' (and associated data), and causes a message to be printed.
# The two ''point names'' used may not be identical; if identical ''point names'' are used the &lt;tt&gt;DAMPER&lt;/tt&gt; statement is ignored and a message is printed.
# The two ''point names'' used must have been defined by previous &lt;tt&gt;POINT&lt;/tt&gt; statements; if not, the &lt;tt&gt;DAMPER&lt;/tt&gt; statement is ignored and a message is printed.
# Each damper defined by a &lt;tt&gt;DAMPER&lt;/tt&gt; statement must be further characterized by a subsequent &lt;tt&gt;DATA DAMPER&lt;/tt&gt; statement. If a &lt;tt&gt;DATA DAMPER&lt;/tt&gt; statement does not appear for each ''damper name'' before an &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE HOLD&lt;/tt&gt; statement is given, then any ''damper name'' with missing data is deleted at that time; a message is printed.
# Care should be taken to insure that, as the system moves, the two end points of the damper are never located at the same position since, in such a case, the direction of the damper's force becomes undefined. If this does occur during the simulation, the effect of that damper is ignored for that position; a message is printed.


==The &lt;tt&gt;FORCE&lt;/tt&gt; Statement==
The &lt;tt&gt;FORCE&lt;/tt&gt; statement defines an externally applied force acting at a defined point on one link of the system. The direction of the force is defined by two points giving its line of action.

===Format===
 &lt;tt&gt;FORCE&lt;/tt&gt; (point name / point name, point name) = force name
where the first ''point name'' is the alphanumeric name of the point of application of the force and also implicitly defines the link to which the force is applied; the second and third ''point names'' are the alphanumeric names of two points which define the line of action of the force; the ''force name'' is an arbitrarily selected alphanumeric name assigned to the force.

===Example===
 &lt;tt&gt;FORCE&lt;/tt&gt; (PT1 / PT2, PT3) = PUSH
defines a force named ''PUSH'' applied at point ''PT1'' and acting along a line parallel to the line from ''PT2'' to ''PT3''.

===Notes===
# Each externally applied force not acting within a joint (see &lt;tt&gt;DATA FORCE&lt;/tt&gt; statement) must be defined by a separate &lt;tt&gt;FORCE&lt;/tt&gt; statement.
# Defining a force as acting within a joint (see &lt;tt&gt;DATA FORCE&lt;/tt&gt; statement) is preferable to use of the &lt;tt&gt;FORCE&lt;/tt&gt; statement, when possible; the numerical accuracy is better and efficiency is much improved.
# No two forces may be defined having the same ''force name''. An attempt to do so results in the deletion of the previously defined force with the same ''force name'' (and associated data) and causes a message to be printed.
# The second and third ''point names'' used may not be identical. If identical ''point names'' are used the statement is ignored and a message is printed.
# There is no restriction against the first and second or first and third ''point names'' used being identical; this may often be desirable.
# The three ''point names'' used must have been defined by previous &lt;tt&gt;POINT&lt;/tt&gt; statements. If not, the &lt;tt&gt;FORCE&lt;/tt&gt; statement is ignored and a message is printed.
# Each externally applied force defined by a &lt;tt&gt;FORCE&lt;/tt&gt; statement must be further characterized by a subsequent &lt;tt&gt;DATA FORCE&lt;/tt&gt; statement. If a &lt;tt&gt;DATA FORCE&lt;/tt&gt; statement does not appear for each ''force name'' before an &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE HOLD&lt;/tt&gt; statement is given then any ''force name'' with missing data is deleted at that time; a message is printed.
# The second and third ''point names'' serve only to define a line parallel to the force, a direction for the force's line of action. These ''point names'' may be attached to any link(s) of the system including the stationary link.
# Care should be taken to insure that, as the system moves, the second and third ''point names'' used are never located at the same position since, in such a case, the direction of the applied force becomes undefined. If this does occur during the simulation, the effect of that ''force name'' is ignored for that position; a message is printed.
# The force is considered positive when directed from the second ''point name'' toward the third ''point name'' specified in the &lt;tt&gt;FORCE&lt;/tt&gt; statement.
# The reaction force for each ''force name'' is assumed to be applied to the fixed link of the system unless explicitly defined by another &lt;tt&gt;FORCE&lt;/tt&gt; statement.


==The &lt;tt&gt;TORQUE&lt;/tt&gt; Statement==
The &lt;tt&gt;TORQUE&lt;/tt&gt; statement defines an externally applied torque acting on one link of the system. The direction of the torque is also defined by specifying two points which determine the direction of its axis.

===Format===
 &lt;tt&gt;TORQUE&lt;/tt&gt; (link name / point name, point name) = torque name
where ''link name'' is the alphanumeric name of the link to which the torque is applied; the ''point names'' are the alphanumeric names of each of two points which define a line parallel to the axis of the torque; the ''torque name'' is an arbitrarily selected alphanumeric name assigned to the torque.

===Example===
 &lt;tt&gt;TORQUE&lt;/tt&gt; (LEVR / PT1, PT2) = TURN
defines a torque named ''TURN'' acting on a link named ''LEVR''; its axis is parallel to the line connecting points named ''PT1'' and ''PT2''.

===Notes===
# Each externally applied torque not acting within a joint (see &lt;tt&gt;DATA FORCE&lt;/tt&gt; statement) must be defined by a separate &lt;tt&gt;TORQUE&lt;/tt&gt; statement.
# Defining a torque as acting within a joint (see &lt;tt&gt;DATA FORCE&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;DATA TORQUE&lt;/tt&gt; statements) is preferable to use of the &lt;tt&gt;TORQUE&lt;/tt&gt; statement, when possible; the numerical accuracy is better and efficiency is much improved.
# No two torques may be defined having the same ''torque name''. An attempt to do so results in the deletion of the previously defined torque with the same ''torque name'' (and associated data), and causes a message to be printed.
# The two ''point names'' used may not be identical. If identical ''point names'' are used, the statement is ignored and a message is printed.
# The ''link name'' used must have been defined in at least one previous statement defining a joint; if not, the &lt;tt&gt;TORQUE&lt;/tt&gt; statement is ignored and a message is printed.
# The two ''point names'' used must have been defined by previous &lt;tt&gt;POINT&lt;/tt&gt; statements; if not, the &lt;tt&gt;TORQUE&lt;/tt&gt; statement is ignored and a message is printed.
# Each externally applied torque defined by a &lt;tt&gt;TORQUE&lt;/tt&gt; statement must be further characterized by a subsequent &lt;tt&gt;DATA TORQUE&lt;/tt&gt; statement. If a &lt;tt&gt;DATA TORQUE&lt;/tt&gt; statement does not appear for each ''torque name'' before an &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE HOLD&lt;/tt&gt; statement is given, then any ''torque name'' with missing data is deleted at that time; a message is printed.
# Either or both of the two ''point names'' used may be attached ''link name'' to which the torque is applied, but this to the is not necessary. Either or both may be attached to any link of the system, including the stationary link.
# Care should be taken that, as the system moves, the two ''point names'' used are never located at the same position since, in such a case, the direction of the axis of the torque becomes undefined. If this does occur during the simulation, the effect of that ''torque name'' is ignored for that position; a message is printed.
# The torque is considered positive when acting counterclockwise (right-hand rule) about the axis directed from the first ''point name'' toward the second ''point name'' specified.
# The reaction torque for each ''torque name'' is assumed applied to the fixed link of the system unless explicitly defined by another &lt;tt&gt;TORQUE&lt;/tt&gt; statement.
