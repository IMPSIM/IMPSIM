The various request statements recognized by the IMP interpreter are presented in this chapter. Request statements are used to define the types of analyses to be performed and the particular quantities which are desired in the output. The first word of each request statement is one of the keywords &lt;tt&gt;PRINT&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;LIST&lt;/tt&gt;, or &lt;tt&gt;STORE&lt;/tt&gt;, and instructs the IMP system to interpret the remainder of the statement according to one of the formats on the following pages.


==The &lt;tt&gt;PRINT VALUE&lt;/tt&gt; Statement==
The &lt;tt&gt;PRINT VALUE&lt;/tt&gt; statement requests that the values and time derivatives of specified &lt;tt&gt;VALUE&lt;/tt&gt; expressions be printed for each position simulated.

===Format===
 PRINT VALUE (name, name, ... )

where each ''name'' is the alphanumeric name of a &lt;tt&gt;VALUE&lt;/tt&gt; expression whose value and derivatives are to be printed.

===Example===
 PRINT VALUE (F1, F2, WAVE, DX)

requests that previously defined &lt;tt&gt;VALUE&lt;/tt&gt; expressions named &lt;tt&gt;F1&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;F2&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;WAVE&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;DX&lt;/tt&gt; and their time derivatives be printed at each position simulated.

===Notes===
# Each ''name'' must be defined in a &lt;tt&gt;VALUE&lt;/tt&gt; statement before the &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE HOLD&lt;/tt&gt; statement is given; if not, each undefined &lt;tt&gt;VALUE&lt;/tt&gt; ''name'' is ignored and a message is printed at each position simulated.
# Each ''name'' must be separated from others by a valid separator.
# No more than 33 ''names'' may be specified in a single &lt;tt&gt;PRINT VALUE&lt;/tt&gt; statement.
# If more than one &lt;tt&gt;PRINT VALUE&lt;/tt&gt; statement is encountered, the lists of ''names'' are concatenated, including repeats if a ''name'' is given more than once.
# The keyword &lt;tt&gt;ALL&lt;/tt&gt; may be used as a ''name'', and requests that all &lt;tt&gt;VALUE&lt;/tt&gt; names be included among those printed.
# The numeric value and the first and second time derivatives are printed for each ''name'' as each position of the system is simulated; they are printed in the order given.
# For any ''name'' whose value or derivatives cannot be calculated at a certain position, the undefined information is printed as &quot;????&quot;

# The frequencies and damping ratios printed correspond to the small amplitude oscillations of the system with all specified generalized coordinates (SGCs) held stationary.
# If the system has no free generalized coordinates (FGCs), it has no rigid body freedoms for oscillation and has no natural frequencies. If this is encountered, the request is ignored and a message is printed at each position simulated.
# Since most mechanical systems simulated are nonlinear, the natural frequencies and damping ratios change with the configuration of the system. They are recalculated and printed at each position simulated.
# If the system is in a stable configuration and not over-damped, there are as many natural frequencies as FGCs. These are printed in units of radians per second and the associated damping ratios (dimensionless) are also printed.
# When one or more of the normal modes of vibration of the system is over-damped, the instantaneous response of the system includes an exponential decay. In this case, the appropriate time constant is printed with units of inverse seconds.
# If the system is in an unstable configuration, its instantaneous response is non-oscillatory and includes an exponential growth rate. Such cases are treated by printing a negative time constant with units of inverse seconds.

requests that two transfer functions be printed showing responses to a unit motion input in the second joint variable (the translation) of the cylindric joint named &lt;tt&gt;CYL&lt;/tt&gt;. The first response printed should be the relative velocity response of the joint named &lt;tt&gt;PIN&lt;/tt&gt;; the second should be the absolute acceleration response of the point named &lt;tt&gt;PT5&lt;/tt&gt;.

Otherwise, the request is ignored and a message is printed.
# If ''namein'' refers to a force name, then ''nin'' may be zero; if ''namein'' refers to a joint name, then ''nin'' must be a positive integer less than or equal to the number of joint variables of that joint. Otherwise, the request is ignored and a message is printed.
# Each ''kind'' must be one of the keywords &lt;tt&gt;POSITION&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;VELOCITY&lt;/tt&gt;, or &lt;tt&gt;ACCEL&lt;/tt&gt;; otherwise the request is ignored and a message is printed.

==The &lt;tt&gt;STORE DYNAMICS&lt;/tt&gt; Statement==
The &lt;tt&gt;STORE DYNAMICS&lt;/tt&gt; statement requests that the small oscillation transfer functions for the vibratory response of specified joints or points of the system to a specified vibratory input force or motion be stored on a file at the end of the simulation.

===Format===
 STORE DYNAMICS(input,namein,nin)=kind,name;kind,name;...

where ''input'' specifies the kind of vibratory input and may be either the keyword &lt;tt&gt;FORCE&lt;/tt&gt; or the keyword &lt;tt&gt;MOTION&lt;/tt&gt;; ''namein'' is the alphanumeric name of the force or joint where the vibratory input excitation is applied; ''nin'' is an integer zero for a &lt;tt&gt;FORCE&lt;/tt&gt; ''input'', or is the integer number of the joint variable within joint ''namein'' for &lt;tt&gt;MOTION&lt;/tt&gt; input. Each ''kind,name'' pair specifies a transfer function to be stored; ''kind'' may be any one of the keywords &lt;tt&gt;POSITION&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;VELOCITY&lt;/tt&gt;, or &lt;tt&gt;ACCEL&lt;/tt&gt; and ''name'' specifies the alphanumeric name of the joint or point whose transfer function is to be stored.

===Examples===
 STORE DYNAMICS (FORCE, PULL, 0) = POSITION, PT1

specifies that the transfer function for the position response of the point named &lt;tt&gt;PT1&lt;/tt&gt; to a unit vibratory force input named &lt;tt&gt;PULL&lt;/tt&gt; is to be stored on a file.

 STORE DYNAMICS(MOTION,CYL,2)=VELOCITY,PIN;ACCEL,PT5

requests that two transfer functions be stored on a file showing responses to a unit motion input in the second joint variable (the translation) of the cylindric joint named &lt;tt&gt;CYL&lt;/tt&gt;. The first should be the relative velocity response of the joint variable of the joint named &lt;tt&gt;PIN&lt;/tt&gt;; the second should be the absolute acceleration response of the point named &lt;tt&gt;PT5&lt;/tt&gt;.

===Notes===
# The requested transfer functions are not stored immediately, but at the completion of the next simulation, after the next &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE HOLD&lt;/tt&gt; statement.
# Since most systems simulated are nonlinear their transfer functions change with the configuration of the system. The desired configuration can be achieved by judicious use of the &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE HOLD&lt;/tt&gt; statement.
# If ''input'' is not one of the keywords &lt;tt&gt;FORCE&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;MOTION&lt;/tt&gt; then the request is ignored and a message is printed.
# If ''input'' is the keyword &lt;tt&gt;FORCE&lt;/tt&gt; then ''namein'' must be defined by a &lt;tt&gt;FORCE&lt;/tt&gt; statement or a joint definition statement before the &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE HOLD&lt;/tt&gt; statement. If ''input'' is the keyword &lt;tt&gt;MOTION&lt;/tt&gt; then ''namein'' must be defined by a joint definition statement before the &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE HOLD&lt;/tt&gt; statement. If not the request is ignored and a message is printed.
# If ''input'' is the keyword &lt;tt&gt;FORCE&lt;/tt&gt; then ''namein'' may not be used in a &lt;tt&gt;DATA POSITION&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;DATA MOTION&lt;/tt&gt; statement. If ''input'' is the keyword &lt;tt&gt;MOTION&lt;/tt&gt;, then ''namein'' must be specified as an SGC by a &lt;tt&gt;DATA POSITION&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;DATA MOTION&lt;/tt&gt; statement before the &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE HOLD&lt;/tt&gt; statement. Otherwise, the request is ignored and a message is printed.
# If ''namein'' refers to a force name then ''nin'' must be zero; if ''namein'' refers to a joint name then ''nin'' must be a positive integer less than or equal to the number of joint variables of that joint. Otherwise the request is ignored and a message is printed.
# Each ''kind'' must be one of the keywords &lt;tt&gt;POSITION&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;VELOCITY&lt;/tt&gt;, or &lt;tt&gt;ACCEL&lt;/tt&gt;; otherwise the request is ignored and a message is printed.
# Each ''name'' must refer to a name defined by a &lt;tt&gt;POINT&lt;/tt&gt; statement or a joint definition statement before the &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;EXECUTE HOLD&lt;/tt&gt; statement. If not, the undefined ''kind,name'' pair is ignored and a message is printed.
# No more than 15 ''kind,name'' pairs may be specified in a single &lt;tt&gt;STORE DYNAMICS&lt;/tt&gt; statement.
